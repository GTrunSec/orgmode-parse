Please place stray thought TODOs in here.

* Enhance the Weekday Parser test.
  At the moment, parserWeekdayTests for some locales are not
  supported, because in such locales the weekdays strings

  - contain characters that are not lexically correct as Haskell strings.
  - contain digits, which should also be rejected by emacs org-mode's parser.

  see test/Weekdays.hs and test/Timestamps.hs .

  Current test for parserWeekdayTests skips such cases. Whether or how
  to support such locales are future work.
